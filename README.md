# K-core-Guided Adaptive Learning and Policy Optimization for Targeted Influence Maximization in Complex Networks

 
## TCQ
 
The repository contains an implementation of Targeted Core-based Q-learning framework (TCQ), , a hybrid optimization approach that draws inspiration from evolutionary network structures derived from K-core decomposition, tailored to tackle the problem of targeted influence maximization (TIM) problem in complex networks.
